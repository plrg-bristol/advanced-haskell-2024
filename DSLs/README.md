## Notes from Sam on the extra content I'll be providing:

I'll be improving based on a course that I took in my undergrad called "Language Engineering", which I actually nicknamed "Advanced haskell", so its pretty fitting.
That's where the notes and worksheets come from to credit to Nick and his interns that made these sheets (altho as you'll see I was one of those interns lol).

This course basically follows a great and accessible paper that he wrote: https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/embedding.pdf

I also gave a more formal eDSL lecture one year of FP:
  - slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_VBk9BFqwWpJZxg4sPm-TMPbHTUxos8sSBwyC8aC3KU/edit?usp=sharing
  - videos:

    * pt 2 - https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/85b52444-fbe7-4f67-a7e2-b9083f2690a6

(note that this doesn't include any binders stuff I mention, that will actually be based on my research :0)

## About Files:

* `DSL.hs` - what I wrote in class with you
* `notes00.pdf` - an outline of what to expect from the "lang eng" course, not really relevant, just skim before you read any of those notes
* `QuidditchDSL.hs` - an example DSL I wrote as Nick's intern, cos I play quidditch (now called quadball - https://quadballuk.org/)
* `sheet01.pdf` - a question sheet about the basics of DSLs, which you should now be able to answer, sadly I don't have the answers, but it should either be obvious, or you can check with me
* `week1-notes.pdf` - notes that cover basically the same as I covered with `DSL.hs`
