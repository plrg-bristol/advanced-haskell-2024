Advanced Haskell
================

Repo for [Jess](https://github.com/ratherforky) and [Sam](https://samfrohlich.github.io/)'s **Advanced Haskell Course**.

This course is optional without assessment or credit associated with it. We hope it will provide a no pressure learning environment, where hopefully we have some fun, and you pick up some functional programming skills along the way.

Course format:
---------------

We have a list of topics, split between us, and on the day, whoever is there picks what they want to hear about, and we will run an improvised session on that topic. If a topic needs more time / is of particular interest, we can return to it in a following week.

Topics:
--------

These topics are split into three difficulty categories: Advanced Haskell, More Advanced Haskell and Most Advanced Haskell. Just to provide a little bit of guidance of what topics should be covered first.

Some topics follow on better from others, so will have "prerequisites". Some topics are based on previous courses, so have worksheets that go with them that we will share if there is interest.
